# My Self-Learning Journey: A Collection of Mini-Projects

Welcome! This repository is a living document of my journey into software development and data science. I believe the best way to learn is by doing, and each project here represents a concrete step in my process of mastering new technologies, concepts, and workflows.

The goal is to tackle small, well-defined problems to build practical, end-to-end skills. Each project is self-contained and includes its own detailed `README.md` explaining the process, challenges, and learnings.

## Projects Overview

The projects are numbered sequentially and often build upon concepts learned in previous ones.

| # | Project | Description | Key Technologies & Concepts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **001** | [**SMS Spam Classifier**](./001-sms-spam-classifier/) | A classic machine learning project that walks through the entire NLP workflow: data cleaning, feature extraction (Bag-of-Words), model training (Naive Bayes), and evaluation. | `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `Pandas`, `NLP`, `Machine Learning Workflow` |
| **002** | [**Svelte Todo Web App**](./002-simple-todo-web/) | A dynamic frontend application for managing a to-do list, built to practice component-based architecture, reactivity, and state management using a modern web framework. | `Svelte (Svelte 5 Runes)`, `TypeScript`, `HTML/CSS`, `Frontend Development`, `State Management` |
| **003** | [**Iris Predictor Web App**](./003-iris-flower-classifier-gui/) | A full-stack application that operationalizes a machine learning model. It combines a Python backend with a simple web interface, demonstrating how to serve predictions to users. | `Python`, `Flask`, `Scikit-learn`, `Joblib`, `HTML/CSS`, `ML Deployment (MLOps)` |

### The Learning Progression

This collection is designed to show a clear progression of skills:
1.  **Standalone Model (`#001`):** Start with the core machine learning logic in a self-contained script.
2.  **Interactive Frontend (`#002`):** Isolate and practice building a user interface, the part the user sees and interacts with.
3.  **Full-Stack Integration (`#003`):** Bridge the gap by connecting a backend model to a frontend interface, creating a complete, usable application.

## My Learning Goals and Future Work

This repository is a work in progress. Based on the foundations built here, my next steps and learning goals include:

*   **Deeper Machine Learning:**
    *   Exploring more advanced models (e.g., SVMs, Gradient Boosting).
    *   Implementing more sophisticated feature engineering techniques like TF-IDF.
*   **Full-Stack & Deployment:**
    *   Integrating a database (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to persist data.
    *   Building RESTful APIs to decouple the frontend and backend.
    *   Deploying applications to cloud services (like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel).
*   **Advanced Frontend:**
    *   Building more complex user interfaces for interacting with data and models.
    *   Integrating third-party APIs to add external data to an application.
